# React/Redux Movie App

- [React Movie App](https://haydnmeyburgh.github.io/react-movie-app/) 

I built this project to practice using Redux Toolkit as well as Thunks for asynchronous calls using an API. 
I used the OMDB movie API to display movies and series as well as to display the specific movie or series details when one of the cards are clicked.

## Tools Used

- Axios for fetch requests
- Redux Toolkit
- React
- React Router DOM
- SCSS for Styling
